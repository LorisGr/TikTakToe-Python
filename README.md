# TikTakToe-Python

TikTakToe is a two-player game written in Python3. This game allows two players to play against each other, with each player taking turns to mark X's or O's on a 3x3 grid. The player to get three of their symbols in a line will be the winner.

##Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have Python3 installed on your computer. You can download the latest version from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/).

Once you have Python3 installed, you can download the source code for the game from Github. To do this, open a terminal window, and enter the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/username/tiktaktoe-python.git`

Once the repository has been cloned, you can run the game by entering the following command:

`python3 tiktaktoe-python.py`

You should now be able to play the game.

##Rules

The rules of the game are simple:

* Each player takes turn to mark X's or O's on the 3x3 grid.
* The first player to get three of their symbols in a line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) will be the winner.
* If all nine squares are filled, and no player has three of their symbols in a line, the game is a draw.
